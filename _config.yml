        #   Pipilika is a search engine operated from Sylhet, Bangladesh. It is the country's first Bangla search engine developed by the Computer Science and Engineering students of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          - **Search Relevancy Improvement:** Improved keyword based search relevancy in all the Pipilika’s search services by designing dynamic schema using Apache Solr supported by calculative implementation of Solr’s dismax query parser Minimum Should Match and query boosting.

          - **A2i Search Portal (http://a2i.pipilika.com):** Spend around six months to find out a generic approach to crawl and parse the unstructured data from various government websites and later on provided REST API using Spring Boot.

          - **Spellchecker Context Aware Library:** After month-long, thorough research into the project improved the file—Dictionary—loading time by 20 seconds.

           - **Solr Analytic Library:** This plug and play library required a lot of individual research to develop. It can provide domain wise time series data for any project build upon Apache Solr.

           - **Rich Document Parser Library:** Wrote generic parser using jsoup library to extract data from file types such as doc, pdf, ppt, csv, etc. Extracting Bangla Unicode data from pdf files was the biggest challenge of all and still under development.
